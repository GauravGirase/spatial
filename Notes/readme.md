## Threads
Threads are lightweight units of execution within a process.
They allow a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time (concurrently) within the same application.
A thread:
- Is the smallest unit of execution managed by a CPU
- Exists inside a process
- Shares memory and resources with other threads in the same process
- Runs independently but cooperatively with other threads
